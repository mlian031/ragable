          <h3>13. Modifications to the Terms</h3>

          <p>
            Ragable reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or
            replace these Terms at any time. If a revision is material, we will
            make reasonable efforts to provide at least 30 days' notice
            prior to any new terms taking effect (e.g., via email, in-app
            notification, or by posting the revised Terms on our website). What
            constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole
            discretion. By continuing to access or use our Service after those
            revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised
            terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you must stop using the
            Service.
          </p>

          <h3>14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Governing Law:</strong> These Terms shall be governed by and
              construed in accordance with the laws of the Province of Ontario
              and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, without regard
              to its conflict of law principles.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Dispute Resolution:</strong> You agree that any dispute,
              claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or
              the breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation, or validity
              thereof or the use of the Service (collectively,
              "Disputes") will be settled by binding arbitration,
              except that each party retains the right: (i) to bring an
              individual action in small claims court and (ii) to seek injunctive
              or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to
              prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or
              violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets,
              patents or other intellectual property rights.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Arbitration Rules:</strong> The arbitration will be
              administered by a recognized arbitration provider mutually agreed
              upon by the parties, under its rules then in effect. The
              arbitration will take place in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada, unless you
              and Ragable agree otherwise.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Class Actions:</strong> YOU AND RAGABLE AGREE THAT EACH
              MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL
              CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED
              CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and
              Ragable agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more
              than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over
              any form of a representative or class proceeding.
            </li>
          </ul>

              Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by
              reference, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding and
              agreement between Ragable and you regarding the Service, and

              understandings or agreements between Ragable and you regarding the
              Service.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Severability:</strong> If any provision of these Terms is
              held to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision will be
              enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and the other

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Waiver:</strong> The failure of Ragable to enforce any
              right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver
              of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or
              provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly
              authorized representative of Ragable.
